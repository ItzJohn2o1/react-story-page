      <p>Once upon a time, three little pigs lived with their mother. When they came of age, she told them it was time to build houses of their own. The first pig, wanting to play, quickly built a house from straw. The second pig built a house from sticks. The third pig, being diligent and hardworking, built a sturdy house from bricks.</p>
      <p>One day, a hungry wolf came along and approached the first pig's house. He huffed and puffed and blew the straw house down, forcing the first pig to run to his brother's stick house. The wolf pursued them and destroyed the stick house as well. Both pigs fled to the brick house of the third pig.</p>
      <p>The wolf tried with all his might to blow down the brick house, but no matter how hard he huffed and puffed, the brick house stood firm. Exhausted and defeated, the wolf gave up and left. The three pigs learned that hard work and persistence pay off, and they lived safely together in the brick house ever after.</p>
